# relsurv_rme_calle_11_20_chile: SUPERVIVENCIA RELATIVA DE PERSONAS EN PROGRAMA DE POBLACI√ìN EN SITUACI√ìN DE CALLE, SENDA, 2011-2020, CHILE

This repository contains all the **R** and **Quarto** files used for the epidemiological analysis and poster presentation on the Relative Survival & $\text{RME}$ (*Relative Mortality Excess*) of individuals participating in the Program between 2011 and 2020.

## Poster Presentation Details

This work was presented as a poster at a major national conference:

* **Conference:** VIII Congreso Chileno de Salud P√∫blica & X Congreso Chileno de Epidemiolog√≠a
* **Topic:** SUPERVIVENCIA RELATIVA DE PERSONAS EN PROGRAMA DE POBLACI√ìN EN SITUACI√ìN DE CALLE, SENDA, 2011-2020, CHILE

## Project Goal and Methodology

The primary objective of this project was to apply **relative survival analysis** to a highly vulnerable population in Chile to accurately estimate mortality compared to the general population (measured by the excess mortality rate).

* **Key Methodology:** Relative Survival Analysis using the `relsurv` R package.
* **Data Source:** Programmatic data from the Chilean National Service for the Prevention and Rehabilitation of Drug and Alcohol Consumption (SENDA), linked to mortality records (DEIS).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Reproducibility and Setup

To run the analysis scripts and render the posters yourself, you'll need the following environment:

### 1. Prerequisites

* **R** (4.1.2)
* **RStudio** (highly recommended for ease of use)
* **Quarto CLI** (usually bundled with RStudio or installable separately)

### 2. Required R Packages

The analysis relies on specialized packages for survival statistics. Install them using the following R code:

```r
if(!require(pacman)){install.packages("pacman");require(pacman)}
